				many more. We may not always know the decisions they face, the risks that
				they take or the sacrifices they make but we trust them because not only do
				they have the knowledge, training, skills and means to do it, but they also
				have the HEART and WILL.

				This is the same for our superheroes. If not for them, your loved ones,
				neighbour, or even doctor may not be here today. So letâ€™s not allow the

				wizards. It's our job to help our superheroes.
