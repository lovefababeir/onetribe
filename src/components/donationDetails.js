        Everyday our heroes, like our doctors, police, firefighters save and
        protect us from terrorists, killers, robbers, bad traffic, infectious
        diseases and many more. We may not always know the decisions they face,
        the risks that they take or the sacrifices they make but we trust them
        because not only do they have the knowledge, training, skills and means
        to do it, but they also have the HEART and WILL.

        This is the same for our superheroes. If not for them, your loved ones,
        neighbour, or even doctor may not be here today. So letâ€™s not allow the
        government to stop them from protecting us from evil aliens, androids
        and wizards. It's our job to help our superheroes.
